    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

abstract = {Emotion recognition is the ability to precisely infer human emotions from numerous sources and modalities using questionnaires, physical signals, and physiological signals. Recently, emotion recognition has gained attention because of its diverse application areas, like affective computing, healthcare, human–robot interactions, and market research. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic review of emotion recognition techniques of the current decade. The paper includes emotion recognition using physical and physiological signals. Physical signals involve speech and facial expression, while physiological signals include electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, and eye tracking. The paper provides an introduction to various emotion models, stimuli used for emotion elicitation, and the background of existing automated emotion recognition systems. This paper covers comprehensive searching and scanning of well-known datasets followed by design criteria for review. After a thorough analysis and discussion, we selected 142 journal articles using PRISMA guidelines. The review provides a detailed analysis of existing studies and available datasets of emotion recognition. Our review analysis also presented potential challenges in the existing literature and directions for future research.}
