# The code from different implementations of GANs

This code was written by hand, line by line, in order for me to understand what others have done before. It made it easier for me to latch onto patterns.

In order to use them, you need to install the dependencies. Python's best practice is to work with virtual environments(venvs). Venvs don't need to be versioned, but the requierments dump should be. 

```bash
# init a venv 
python3 -m venv .venv

```

Each GAN is described in a README file, which describes the results on different training datasets.
